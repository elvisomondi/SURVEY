# SURVEY
Second Course Project for BSc. SE
The Surveying system was my third year project for my course, BSc. Software Engineering. 
It is a system that can be used by institutions and businesses to gather information from their clients, customers and employees. The surveys are created within the system and sent to the customers emails where the customers can take them and submit them when finished.
The results will then be compiled once the time set to carry out the survey has expired and numerous reports, including graphical reports are generated.
